# AGENTS.md

Canonical contributor + agent contract for `apet97/clockify-ts-sdk`.
Standalone repo — no parent project. The `addons-me/` prefix you
may see in some absolute paths is one contributor's local workspace
folder; it is not part of the contract.

The sister repository `apet97/go-clockify` (referred to as
**GOCLMCP**, its conventional local clone directory) owns the
canonical Clockify OpenAPI generator. The two are cloned as
siblings so `../GOCLMCP/...` resolves from this repo's root.
Adjust paths if your layout differs.

Read this whole file before touching anything. Every rule below
applies to humans and AI agents equally.

## 1. Identity & boundary

This is an independent, community-built project — **not affiliated with,
endorsed by, or sponsored by CAKE.com or Clockify** ("Clockify" is a CAKE.com
trademark, used nominatively; the `-115` / `115` suffixes are deliberate
trademark distance). See [`NOTICE.md`](./NOTICE.md).

This repo ships three sibling npm packages, each from its own
subdirectory:

- **`wrapper/`** → `clockify-sdk-ts-115` — the core TypeScript SDK,
  local-generator output + hand-written ergonomics. The original product.
  Local build artefact: `wrapper/dist/`.
- **`cli/`** → `@clockify115/cli` — `clockify115` / `clk115` command-line
  interface on top of the SDK. **59 commands** across 21 top-level
  groups including `reports`, `shared-reports`, `users`, `doctor`, `completion`, the
  scriptable `api` raw command, and the workflow shortcuts (`start`, `stop`, `status`, `log`,
  `entries`, `projects`, `clients`, `tasks`, `tags`, `webhooks`,
  `invoices`, `expenses`, `timeoff`, `scheduling`, `audit-log`). The
  resource groups carry full CRUD (`list`/`create`/`get`/`update`/`delete`,
  with archive-then-delete for active projects/clients/tasks).
  Output controls: `--output table|json|ndjson`, `--compact`,
  `--select <dot-path>`. Local build artefact: `cli/dist/`.
- **`mcp/`** → `@clockify115/mcp-server` — stdio Model Context Protocol
  server, sibling to the Go MCP in GOCLMCP. **134 tools**: 21
  workflow/orientation tools plus 113 domain tools across 19 resource groups.
  Workflow tools cover daily time tracking, work-package setup,
  review/fix, invoices, expenses, time off, scheduling, webhooks,
  and demo seed/cleanup; read-only orientation tools
  (`clockify_docs_search`, `clockify_operation_guide`,
  `clockify_sdk_snippet`) help an agent pick the smallest correct
  surface. Domain tools provide broad CRUDL coverage including the four
  report tools; the raw API fallback remains the Go MCP's niche. Local
  build artefact: `mcp/dist/`.
  MCP write-safety is part of this product contract: high-risk
  workflow writes and destructive domain deletes share the
  `dry_run` -> `confirm_token` guard in
  `mcp/src/orchestration/confirm-guard.ts`, while
  `clockify_setup_webhook` validates callback URLs through
  `mcp/src/orchestration/webhook-url.ts` before either preview or
  creation. That webhook guard is intentionally offline and covers
  literal URL/host/IP risks, not DNS rebinding.

The `-115` / `115` suffix is intentional trademark distance from
Clockify. We do not plan to publish any of these to npm; the
`publishConfig` blocks + `prepublishOnly` scripts remain so anyone
who decides otherwise inherits the right gates. MCP tool prefixes
(`clockify_status`, etc.) stay because they mirror the Clockify API
and are validated by `../GOCLMCP/` drift gates.

The three packages are wired as npm workspaces from a root
`package.json` (`workspaces: ["wrapper", "cli", "mcp"]`). A single
root `package-lock.json` covers all three; the per-package
lockfiles are gone. Each package keeps its own `package.json`,
`tsconfig.json`, build chain, and tests; you run them either via
`npm run <script> -w <package-name>` from the root or via
`cd <pkg> && npm run <script>` (the latter still works because the
workspace symlinks satisfy local resolutions).

If packed/published, the `wrapper/` package includes:
- `wrapper/dist/**` (built from `wrapper/src/**` via twin tsc)
- `wrapper/README.md`, `wrapper/LICENSE`, `wrapper/package.json`

If packed/published, the `cli/` package includes:
- `cli/dist/**` (built from `cli/src/**` via tsc)
- `cli/README.md`, `cli/LICENSE`, `cli/package.json`

If packed/published, the `mcp/` package includes:
- `mcp/dist/**` (built from `mcp/src/**` via tsc)
- `mcp/README.md`, `mcp/LICENSE`, `mcp/package.json`

Doesn't ship on npm (but lives here for reproducibility):
- `spec/` — corrected OpenAPI snapshot, historical Fern config, and evidence ledger
- `output/ts-sdk/` — local TypeScript generator output, **gitignored**;
  regenerable by running `make sdk-codegen`, which invokes
  `scripts/generate-sdk-from-openapi.mjs` against the corrected OpenAPI
  snapshot and then syncs `wrapper/src/**`.
- `wrapper/{src,dist,node_modules}/` — gitignored; recreated by the build chain
- `cli/{dist,node_modules}/` — gitignored
- `mcp/{dist,node_modules}/` — gitignored
- `node_modules/` (workspace root) — gitignored
- `.github/workflows/` — CI + release pipelines
- `spec/evidence/probes/*.{json,hdr}` — gitignored live API captures

The canonical Clockify OpenAPI is **NOT** in this repo. It's
generated by `scripts/gen-clockify-openapi` in `apet97/go-clockify`
(`../GOCLMCP/`) from a curated source bundle. The file at
`spec/corrected/clockify.corrected.openapi.yaml` is a snapshot,
refreshed by `cp` after every regen in GOCLMCP.

## 2. First reads (in order)

1. `README.md` (this repo) — workflow overview.
2. `wrapper/README.md` — the SDK package README.
3. `mcp/README.md` — the workflow-first MCP user surface.
4. `docs/product-north-star.md` — final-state quality bar for this
   repo as a polished SDK/CLI/MCP product, not just generated code.
5. `spec/evidence/discrepancies.md` — ledger of every divergence
   between Clockify's published spec, live behaviour, and the shape
   we ship. Five-question format per entry (official claim, actual
   behaviour, live evidence, MCP tools affected, open questions,
   status). Read before adding any new annotation, override, or
   workaround — it almost certainly has prior context.
6. `../GOCLMCP/scripts/gen-clockify-openapi` — the Ruby generator.
   Sections to know:
   - `TAG_RENAMES` — collapses singular/plural tag duplicates
   - `PATH_PARAM_PATTERNS` + `stamp_path_param_patterns!` — stamps
     `^[0-9a-fA-F]{24}$` on `expenseId` / `invoiceId` / `assignmentId`
   - `PAGINATED_LIST_OPS` + `ensure_pagination!` — stamps `page` +
     `page-size` on 21 list endpoints
   - `LAST_PAGE_HEADER_OPS` + `stamp_last_page_header!` — stamps
     `x-clockify-last-page-header: true` on 18 endpoints that emit
     the header
   - `SDK_METHOD_NAMES` + `stamp_sdk_method_name!` — pairs
     `x-fern-sdk-group-name` + `x-fern-sdk-method-name` on 155 ops
     across 27 modules
   - `PHANTOM_PATHS` + `phantom_path?` — 27 quarantined live-404/405
     routes (3 round-1 timeOff legacy, 3 round-2 G.1 edge cases,
     plus bare `/balance` × 2, `/scheduling/capacity` × 1, and
     `/time-entries/stop` × 1)
   - per-operation `servers` overrides on the reports, audit-log, and
     shared/expense-report ops. `scripts/generate-sdk-from-openapi.mjs`
     reads `operation.servers[0].url` and emits `OperationSpec.baseUrl`,
     so `client.reports.*` / `client.auditLogReport.*` reach their real
     hosts (`reports.api.clockify.me`, `auditlog-api.api.clockify.me`)
     instead of the default `api.clockify.me/api/v1`. An explicit
     `baseUrl`/`environment` override still wins.
7. `spec/fern/{fern.config.json,generators.yml}` — historical Fern
   workspace. It is retained for evidence and fallback context only;
   the active TypeScript SDK emitter is
   `scripts/generate-sdk-from-openapi.mjs`.

## 2a. Product north star

This repo should feel like a carefully finished SDK company product,
not a loose generator dump:

- The OpenAPI snapshot is trusted because GOCLMCP generated it from
  curated sources, live probes, drift gates, and explicit discrepancy
  records.
- Generated code is a lower layer. Public ergonomics live in small,
  durable wrappers with focused tests, stable exports, and clear
  examples.
- The SDK, CLI, and MCP speak the same domain language. If a workflow
  is easy in the MCP, the underlying SDK/CLI path should also be
  obvious.
- Agent-facing APIs return structured receipts: ids, `changed`,
  `next`, warnings, stable error codes, and recovery instructions
  where useful. MCP domain create/update/delete tools populate
  `entity` + `changed` via the shared `writeReceipt` helper
  (`mcp/src/result.ts`), matching the workflow tier.
- Documentation is part of the product. README examples must be
  runnable, concise, and current; generated API docs must not
  contradict package READMEs or agent guidance.
- The final quality bar is "would a user believe this came from a
  focused SDK vendor?" If not, remove ceremony, tighten names, add
  proof, or shrink the abstraction until it is obvious.

When coding toward this bar, prefer generator/source fixes first,
hand-written wrapper seams second, deterministic postgen cleanup only
as an escape hatch, and live contract proof last. Do not add broad
frameworks, codegen layers, or AI-helper narration unless they remove
real maintenance cost.

## 3. The build chain (top to bottom)

Each arrow is a script invocation that must succeed for the next
stage to be valid. Never skip a stage; never run a pack/publish gate
without all upstream gates green.

`make sdk-codegen` runs `scripts/generate-sdk-from-openapi.mjs`
locally. It does not require Docker, a hosted SDK-generator account,
or Clockify credentials. Because `output/ts-sdk/**` is gitignored, a
fresh clone needs `make sdk-codegen` before SDK package gates can run;
the validators that depend on `wrapper/src/**` (schema-quality,
generator-comparison) skip with a clear generated-tree warning when
the tree is absent so non-SDK workflows can still run perfect-fast.

## 4. Verify gates (run before every commit)

Root shortcuts for non-coder operation and future-agent handoff:

| Goal | Run |
|---|---|
| See available gates | `make help` |
| Fast deterministic local proof | `make perfect-fast` |
| Full GOCLMCP + local SDK codegen + package + packed-consumer proof | `make perfect-full` |
| Explicit sandbox/live cleanup proof | `make perfect-live` |
| Refresh SDK/CLI/MCP product metadata | `make product-surface` |
| Refresh shared error/recovery docs | `make error-docs` |
| Refresh troubleshooting guide from error registry | `make troubleshooting` |
| Refresh corrected OpenAPI operation inventory | `make openapi-operations` |
| Refresh OpenAPI/SDK/MCP operation parity | `make operation-parity` |
| Check corrected OpenAPI contract invariants | `make openapi-lint` |
| Regenerate local TypeScript SDK output | `make sdk-codegen` |
| Check local TypeScript SDK generation drift | `make sdk-codegen-drift` |
| Run local generator fixture/golden tests | `make sdk-codegen-test` |
| Check generated-core replaceability boundaries | `make generator-independence` |
| Compare OpenAPI SDK stamps to generated TS methods | `make generator-comparison` |
| Refresh generated CLI/MCP README tables | `make readme-tables` |
| Check touched package changelog coverage | `make changelog-drift` |
| Check documentation index links | `make docs-index-drift` |
| Check package size/startup budgets | `make performance-budgets` |
| Check wrapper build-output determinism | `make build-determinism` |
| Replay redacted typed cassettes | `make cassettes` |
| Run wrapper + mcp mutation-score gate | `make mutation` |
| Check package tarball snapshots | `make pack-snapshot-check` |
| Optional sandbox key preflight | `CLOCKIFY_API_KEY='' CLOCKIFY_WORKSPACE_ID='' make sandbox-key-health` |
| Check future-agent guidance parity | `make agent-handoff` |
| Print a no-network operator plan/report | `node scripts/plan.mjs <topic>` — topics: `acceptance`, `change-impact`, `contract-inventory`, `examples`, `maintenance`, `onboarding`, `performance-calibration`, `release-decision`, `risk-status`, `workflow`. Per-topic modules under `scripts/<topic>-plan.mjs` / `<topic>-report.mjs` are libraries — do not add a new standalone CLI; add a topic to `plan.mjs` instead. |

**Run `perfect-fast` solo and with creds blanked:**
`CLOCKIFY_API_KEY='' CLOCKIFY_WORKSPACE_ID='' make perfect-fast`. With creds set the
live `sandbox.test.ts` suites run and 401 on an expired/absent key; blanked they
self-skip, so the run is deterministic and offline. The `performance-budgets`
startup-time checks (`cli-version` ≤600ms, `mcp-tools-list` ≤1200ms) flake under CPU contention —
don't run other heavy work alongside the gate, or you'll see false reds. For a fast
inner loop use the per-package gates (they skip the startup budgets); `perfect-fast`
also runs `lint` (incl. mcp eslint), which the per-package `type-check`/`test`/`build`
do not — run `npm run lint -w <pkg>` before claiming green.

| Change scope | Run |
|---|---|
| Generator (`../GOCLMCP/scripts/gen-clockify-openapi`) | `make gen-openapi` + all 4 drift gates + `go test ./internal/tools/...` |
| Upstream sources (`GOCLMCP/docs/openapi/sources/`) | same as generator |
| `spec/corrected/` snapshot only | never — see §5 |
| `scripts/generate-sdk-from-openapi.mjs` | `make sdk-codegen` + `make sdk-codegen-drift` + `make sdk-codegen-test` + `make generator-comparison` + `cd wrapper && npm run type-check && npm test && npm run build && npm run build:smoke` |
| `spec/fern/{generators.yml, fern.config.json}` | historical/fallback config only; do not restore it as the active TS generation path without maintainer approval |
| `wrapper/src/**` | not allowed — wiped by `npm run sync` |
| `wrapper/scripts/sync-sdk.sh` | run `npm run sync` and verify the synced file count is sensible (it tracks the generated tree, so the exact number moves with each regen) |
| `wrapper/*.ts` root files (hand-written modules; currently 29, excluding `vitest.config.ts`) | `npm run type-check` + `npm test` + `npm run build` + `npm run build:smoke` + `npm pack --dry-run`. After adding a new hand-written module: add it to `tsconfig.{json,esm.json,cjs.json}` `include`, a subpath entry in `package.json` `exports` (both `import` + `require` conditions, each with `types` + `default`), and the expected-names array in `wrapper/scripts/verify-dual-build.sh`. |
| `wrapper/CHANGELOG.md` | edit-only, no gates — runs alongside whatever change prompted the entry |
| `wrapper/{package.json, tsconfig*.json, README.md, LICENSE, vitest.config.ts, tests/**, examples/**}` | `npm run type-check` + `npm test` + `npm pack --dry-run`. Examples are type-checked via `tsconfig.json` `include` — drift in the synced SDK that breaks an example signature fails the type-check. |
| `cli/**` | `cd cli && npm run type-check && npm test && npm run build && npm pack --dry-run`. Live tests skip without sandbox env. |
| `mcp/**` | `cd mcp && npm run type-check && npm test && npm run build && npm pack --dry-run`. For behavior changes, also run a stdio or in-memory MCP probe that exercises `tools/list`, at least one success envelope, one recovery envelope, and cleanup. |
| `docs/product-north-star.md` or `docs/superpowers/plans/**` | Markdown-only. Run `git diff --check -- docs AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md README.md` and, when the prompt changes code expectations, skim the referenced package READMEs for drift. |
| `.github/workflows/**` | the security-guidance hook may block the first `Write` per session; retry once. Lint with `gh workflow view <name>`. |
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | edit-only, no gates (GitHub validates on next poll). Commits with `chore(deps)` / `chore(dev-deps)` / `chore(ci)` prefixes per the file's `commit-message` config. |
| `wrapper/typedoc.json` | `npm run docs` (regenerates `docs/api/`; failures block the docs.yml workflow). |

After any spec or generator change, the FULL chain in §3 must run
end-to-end and green before push. Drift gates are non-negotiable.

## 5. Critical conventions (the rules that bite)

1. **Never edit `spec/corrected/clockify.corrected.openapi.yaml`.**
   It's a regenerable snapshot. Edits land in upstream sources
   (`GOCLMCP/docs/openapi/sources/**`) or in the generator script.
   The only legitimate local diff is a straight copy from
   `../GOCLMCP/docs/openapi/clockify-openapi.yaml` after the GOCLMCP
   generator and drift gates are green; for that handoff, run the final
   full gate with `CLOCKIFY_ALLOW_GENERATED_DIFF=1` and keep the diff to
   the copied snapshot plus regenerated SDK/package surfaces.
2. **Never edit `output/ts-sdk/**`.** `make sdk-codegen` wipes
   the tree on every regen. Hand-written code lives in `wrapper/`.
3. **Never edit `wrapper/src/**`.** `npm run sync` wipes + repopulates
   from `output/ts-sdk/`. The sync script intentionally skips
   `package.json`, `tsconfig*.json`, `node_modules/`, lockfiles, and
   `.gitignore` so the wrapper's versions survive.
4. **Never commit raw probe files (`spec/evidence/probes/*.{json,hdr}`).**
   Gitignored already. Promote canonical findings into
   `spec/evidence/discrepancies.md` and reference the probe by
   relative path.
5. **Never run `npm publish` from a developer laptop.** Default
   stance is no npm publication; a future publish decision needs
   explicit maintainer approval and a dry-run first.
6. **Never push a tag that doesn't match `package.json` version.**
   The release workflow's tag-vs-version guard fails the job; the
   consequence is a half-burnt git tag that needs cleanup.
7. **Drift gates must pass after every spec change.** All four:
   `openapi-drift`, `catalog-drift`, `selfinspect-drift`,
   `raw-allowlist-drift`. Skipping any is silent data corruption —
   the GOCLMCP MCP layer derives its tool catalog from the canonical
   spec.
8. **`go test ./internal/tools/...` in GOCLMCP must pass after every
   spec change.** Same reason — the Go tool layer parses the
   canonical YAML.
9. **No `it.skip` / `test.skip` / `xit` / `xdescribe` in `wrapper/tests/`.**
   Use the env-gated `describe.skip` pattern from
   `tests/sandbox.test.ts` for live tests. Never skip silently.
10. **MCP id-slots resolve a name to an id before any write.** The
    holidays, time-off (policy/request/balance/request-policy slots),
    expenses (category slots), scheduling, groups `add_member`, and
    users grant/revoke-role tools resolve supported names before the
    write call. A 24-hex id passes through; unresolved or ambiguous
    names stop before mutation as either a grounded `clarification`
    receipt or a structured error, depending on the resolver path. Read
    filter slots stay list-free. The shared `mcp/src/scope-filter.ts`
    splits its `status`:
    time-off **policies** scope `"ACTIVE"`, holidays keep `"ALL"`
    (`spec/evidence/discrepancies.md`
    `time-off.policies.scope.status-active-not-all`). Adds no tools
    (the surface is 134); arg-shape coercion (`zStringList` /
    `zNumberLike` in `mcp/src/arg-shapes.ts`) keeps the
    model-visible JSON Schema unchanged. Change the tool, its test,
    and the ledger together.

`"files": ["dist", "README.md", "LICENSE"]` in `package.json`
whitelists what `npm pack` includes. Do not add without a
pack/readiness review. `CHANGELOG.md` is intentionally omitted to
keep the tarball lean.

Twenty-seven subpaths in `package.json` `exports` at v0.9.0 (the root `.` plus 26 named), each with `import` +
`require` conditions (modern dual-tier shape: `{ types, default }` per condition so
TS resolves ESM vs CJS types correctly). The canonical, governed list lives in
`docs/sdk-public-api.json` (`subpaths` + `tsconfigAliases`), kept in lockstep with
`package.json` exports, the tsconfig path aliases, and `verify-dual-build.sh` by
`make sdk-public-api` — edit there, not by hand-listing here. The 26 named subpaths:
`create-client`, `composed-fetch`, `errors`, `deprecation`, `iter`, `pagination`,
`paginated-list`, `webhooks`, `webhook-events`, `with-response`, `scoped-client`,
`otel-hooks`, `health`, `rate-limit`, `diagnostics`, `request-options`,
`operation-receipt`, `money`, `invoice-body`, `resolve`, `dates`, `ensure`,
`requests`, `reports`, `bulk`, and `compose`.

`package.json` also carries `publishConfig: { access: public,
provenance: true }` for the legacy release path. Because that would
publish publicly with sigstore provenance, do not trigger it without
explicit maintainer approval.

The local generator models `apiKey` and `addonToken` as mutually
exclusive. Do not reintroduce the historical
`addonToken: (() => undefined) as unknown as () => string` workaround;
that belongs only to the archived Fern discrepancy notes.

## 7. Live tests (env-gated; sandbox-only)

Three live sandbox suites read `CLOCKIFY_API_KEY` and
`CLOCKIFY_WORKSPACE_ID`. All skip cleanly if either is absent (CI
runs without them deliberately):

- `wrapper/tests/sandbox.test.ts` — 7 SDK-level flows (CRUD on tags,
  pagination walks via `paginate` / `iterAll` / `iterPages`,
  `withResponse` headers smoke).
- `cli/tests/sandbox.test.ts` — 8 CLI flows invoking `main()` in
  `--json` mode and parsing stdout. Covers `status`, `tags list`,
  `projects list`, `clients list`, `webhooks list`, `invoices list`,
  `expenses list`, and `audit-log search`. The audit-log test
  self-skips when the workspace plan gates the endpoint.
- `mcp/tests/sandbox.test.ts` — 11 MCP flows. Uses real
  `loadContext()` + `buildServer()` piped through
  `InMemoryTransport.createLinkedPair()`. Covers `clockify_status`,
  list tools, tag create/delete, work-package create/reuse cleanup,
  derived-start work logging, review-day totals, and fix-entry update
  cleanup.

**Never run live tests against a customer workspace.** Every CRUD
round-trip creates and deletes records on the pinned sandbox.

When adding live flows:
- Pair create with delete in the same `it` block.
- Use timestamp-prefixed slugs (`sdk-test-${Date.now()}`,
  `mcp-sandbox-${Date.now()}`) so litter from aborted runs is
  identifiable.
- `testTimeout: 30_000` is already in `vitest.config.ts` (wrapper)
  and inline on each `it` in cli/mcp suites.
- Treat any 401 / 5xx as a test bug, not a spec bug, until proven
  otherwise. Run the curl equivalent by hand before changing
  assertions.

## 8. Known deferred / blocked items

Tracked in `spec/evidence/discrepancies.md` with full repro:

1. `fern.x-fern-pagination.bare-array-unsupported` — Fern CLI
   5.37.9 rejects `results: $response` for bare-array responses.
   The wrapper's hand-written `paginate<T>` / `iterAll` / `iterPages`
   are the supported pagination surface. Re-evaluate on every Fern
   CLI bump. Upstream issue drafted at
   `spec/evidence/fern-issues/bare-array-pagination-results-path.md`
   (internal evidence only — not filed).
2. `fern.sdk.auth.addonToken-typed-required-but-mutually-exclusive`
   — historical Fern limitation where both `apiKey` and `addonToken`
   were typed as required even though Clockify accepts exactly one.
   The local generator now emits mutually-exclusive auth options; keep
   the discrepancy entry as migration evidence only.
   Issue drafted at
   `spec/evidence/fern-issues/addonToken-or-security-required-fields.md`
   (internal evidence only — not filed).
3. `fern.x-fern-sdk-method-name.drops-resource-modules` — resolved
   in v0.5.0 by pairing `x-fern-sdk-group-name` +
   `x-fern-sdk-method-name`. Coverage: 155 ops / 27 modules /
   91.7% of the 169-op live surface. The other ~14 ops are
   already-clean operationIds or per-module domain edge cases.
   (This 155 is the fern *pairing* count. The SDK README states 156 —
   total method-name coverage — which adds the one operationId-derived
   method, `expenseReport.generateDetailedReportV1`, to these 155.)

Re-attempt item 1 only after the upstream gating concern resolves
(Fern issue acknowledged or workaround discovered).

### Shipped live-success waves

Each wave probed the sacrificial sandbox with `Leftovers:0`; full per-op wire-facts
and evidence live in `spec/evidence/discrepancies.md`. Historical denominators are
184 (the op set before the 2026-06-23 surface refresh); the current op set is 169.

| Date | Wave | live-success | Highlights |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-20 | structural | 46 → 67/184 | 21 read-side GET promotions; expenses + invoices joined `PAGINATED_LIST_OPS` (webhooks left out — non-paginated); consumer `as never` 27 → 7; vitest unified `^4` + re-pinned coverage floors; ten mutation survivors killed |
| 2026-06-21 | write CRUD | 67 → 81/184 | `createExpense` + user-group/webhook/custom-field write CRUD, `updateHoliday`, shared-reports write CRUD; `note` dropped from `ChangeTimeOffRequestStatusRequest.required`; scheduling-totals GET now requires `start`/`end` (400 code 3001 without); `expenses/categories` paginated; webhook SSRF guard blocks NAT64 `64:ff9b::/96` |
| 2026-06-22 | generator + writes | 81 → 87/184 | `$ref` query params restored (`ensure_path_parameters!`) — fixed `scheduling.list` + schedule-totals GETs needing `start`/`end`; `clockify_time_off_requests_delete` rewired to `timeOff.withdraw`; time-off request create/delete, expense delete + category archive, project-membership PATCH/POST |
| 2026-06-22 | CRUD probe | 87 → 111/184 | invoices CRUD + items, time-off policy CRUD, project template/estimate, task rates, expense update + category delete, per-user time-entries, users filter, scheduling user-capacity totals; `/time-entries/invoiced/bulk` deferred (live 404); paginated count 10 → 23 (`$ref` page params) |
| 2026-06-23 | API-key probe | 111 → 129/184 | workspace/user/project-user rates, invoice settings + status, manager-role grant/revoke, remove-user-from-group, member-profile PATCH, time-off balance PATCH, entity-info reads, webhook logs + addon webhooks; flagged ~21 live-404/405 spec ops + 2 missing official ops |
| 2026-06-23 | surface refresh | 184 → 169 ops; 129 → **135/169** | quarantined 17 confirmed-wrong ops via `PHANTOM_PATHS`, added 2 missing official ops (`getWebhookEventStatusesWithLatestLog` live, `addLimitedUsersWithInfo` documented), promoted 6 stragglers; cascaded to the wrapper (dropped dead `.policies` accessor) and CLI/MCP scheduling-create (repointed to live `createRecurring`, since `POST /scheduling/assignments` 404s) |
| 2026-06-23 | schema fidelity | **135/169** (unchanged) | Live-wire audit fixed three response schemas a thin probe-lab schema had shadowed via the generator's first-writer name race: restored `Client.ccEmails`/`currencyId`; corrected `SharedReport` (`isPublic`/`link` + `reportAuthor`/`visibleToUsers`/`visibleToUserGroups`/`fixedDate`/`workspaceId`/`userId`; dropped phantom `url`/`createdAt`/`updatedAt`/`workspace`); added `Webhook.deliveryEnabled`/`planEnabled`. Fixed CLI/MCP shared-reports create/update sending the API-ignored `public` (wire is `isPublic`, live-proved). Added `spec-sync-drift` (SDK↔GOCLMCP byte-parity gate) + a GOCLMCP manifest reverse-completeness check; `secret-hygiene` now catches bare `KEY=value`/`.env` |

## 9. Secret hygiene

- `CLOCKIFY_API_KEY` and `CLOCKIFY_WORKSPACE_ID` belong in the
  developer's shell. Never commit, never echo unredacted, never
  paste in Slack / GitHub comments.
- `make secret-hygiene` catches the bare `KEY=value` / `export KEY=value` form (not
  only quoted), via an optional-quote + digit-lookahead regex, and `.env*` is
  gitignored so a committed `.env` is impossible outright. It is still best-effort
  (defers to gitleaks for deep audits).
- `NPM_TOKEN` lives in the repo's GitHub Actions secrets. Use an
  **automation** token with **Publish** scope, **no expiry** (or
  ≤1 year), and rotate after every npm push.
- `gh auth status` token belongs to one developer machine, not CI.
  CI uses the per-job `GITHUB_TOKEN` for read-only checkout.

## 10. Commit & branch hygiene

- Conventional prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`,
  `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:`. One logical change per commit.
- Subject line ≤ 72 chars. Wrap body at 72.
- Generated code (under `output/ts-sdk/`) is **gitignored**; you regenerate
  it locally with `make sdk-codegen` before running SDK package gates. When a generator
  change touches many files, describe the *change to the generator*, not the
  diff to the generated files. Example:
  > `feat(gen): stamp page+page-size on 18 list endpoints`
- Never push to `main` from a feature branch via PR-merge UI without
  CI green on the PR head. Direct pushes to `main` are reserved for
  hotfixes you can defend in writing.
- Do not amend a published commit. Add a new commit on top.
- Do not skip hooks (`--no-verify`) or bypass signing
  (`--no-gpg-sign`). If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.

## 11. Doc maintenance

- The retired final-readiness receipt make-target family (the former
  draft/check/final receipt targets and the goal-status report) was removed
  on 2026-05-28. `make enterprise-audit` remains; and
  `scripts/check-enterprise-hardening.mjs` no longer carries a `--final` mode
  or asserts `audit.wiring.finalMakeTarget`. The residual textual references
  across `docs/risk-register.md`, `docs/release-readiness-checklist.md`,
  `docs/maintenance-playbook.md`, and the `scripts/*-plan.mjs` emitters have
  now been removed, with the cross-validating audit/contract markers updated
  in lockstep. Only the historical
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-26-enterprise-sdk-hardening.md` and
  `docs/decisions/0004-sandbox-only-live-proof.md` records retain the old
  terminology. Restoring or further changing the release workflow is a
  maintainer call — do not invent the targets back without one.
- Every spec-shape change ships with a `spec/evidence/discrepancies.md`
  entry using the five-question format. An entry is not a substitute
  for fixing the issue; it's a trail that lets the next agent
  understand why the code looks the way it does.
- `wrapper/README.md` is the SDK package README. Update for any
  user-visible change: new method, new auth requirement, changed
  pagination shape, deprecation. Don't duplicate build-chain detail
  there; that lives in this `AGENTS.md` and the workspace `README.md`.
- `mcp/README.md` is the MCP-facing README. Update for any tool
  addition/removal, envelope field, stable error code, confirmation
  flow, or workflow example change. Cross-check the workflow table
  against `tools/list` and GOCLMCP's `docs/tool-catalog.json`.
- `docs/product-north-star.md` and `docs/superpowers/plans/**` are
  planning/guidance artifacts. Keep them executable: exact files,
  exact commands, explicit non-goals, and no placeholder phrases.
- `wrapper/CHANGELOG.md` follows Keep-a-Changelog. `[Unreleased]`
  on top; user-visible changes go there between releases. On tag day
  rename `[Unreleased]` → `[X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` and add a fresh
  empty `[Unreleased]`. Each version entry references the relevant
  `discrepancies.md` anchors for any limitation it inherits or
  closes. `CHANGELOG.md` is intentionally not in `package.json`
  `files` so the npm tarball stays lean.

## 12. Out of scope (FLAG and stop)

These require explicit author approval before any code or config
touches them. If asked to do one without prior buy-in, surface the
request and stop:

1. Editing `../GOCLMCP/scripts/gen-clockify-openapi`'s merge /
   dedup logic (lines ~700–880). One bug there destroyed 26
   request-body interfaces last cycle. Adding entries to
   `PATH_PARAM_PATTERNS`, `PAGINATED_LIST_OPS`, `TAG_RENAMES`,
   `LAST_PAGE_HEADER_OPS`, `SDK_METHOD_NAMES`, or `PHANTOM_PATHS`
   is fine — those are data-only.
2. Renaming the npm package (`clockify-sdk-ts-115`). The repo's git
   name (`clockify-ts-sdk`) and the npm name diverged intentionally.
3. Restoring Fern, Speakeasy, Stainless, or another hosted/paid SDK
   generator as the active TypeScript generation path. That needs a
   maintainer decision and a full regression cycle.
4. Reintroducing the historical `addonToken` workaround cast
   (`addonToken: (() => undefined) as unknown as () => string`) in
   `wrapper/`. The local generator now models `apiKey`/`addonToken` as
   mutually exclusive (see §6, §8.2); the cast is archived Fern-era
   evidence only, and restoring it needs a maintainer decision and a
   full auth regression cycle.
5. Anything that affects a customer workspace (running tests
   against a non-sandbox API key, posting to a production webhook,
   etc.).
6. Pushing to any `apet97/*` remote with `--force`, deleting any
   branch, or running `git reset --hard origin/main` on `main`.
7. Editing `.github/workflows/release.yml` such that npm publish
   could fire without a tag (e.g. on push to main). The tag gate is
   load-bearing.
